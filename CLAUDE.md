# CLAUDE.md — Nova

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repo.

## What this is

**Nova** — a mobile AI call copilot. Phone mic (speakerphone/acoustic capture) →
streaming STT with diarization → live text suggestions + post-call structured notes,
grounded in per-user RAG memory. Company-held API keys; users pay subscription.
Silent text copilot: no TTS, no bots joining calls, transcript-only storage.

**Stack:** npm-workspaces monorepo — `apps/server` (Node/TS, Fastify),
`apps/mobile` (React Native + Expo), `packages/shared` (zod schemas/types),
`supabase/` (Postgres + RLS + pgvector migrations).

**Status: pre-scaffold.** Phase 0 of `docs/LOOP_PLAYBOOK.md` creates the workspaces.

## Read before doing ANYTHING

1. `docs/RULES.md` — the engineering constitution. Binding. Highlights:
   - zod-parse every boundary; TS strict; no `any`
   - vendor SDKs ONLY inside `modules/*/adapters/`
   - soft delete always (`deleted_at`); hard delete only in `scripts/purge/`
   - migrations: expand→backfill→contract, never edit applied ones, RLS ships with tables
   - every PR updates the living docs it affects (ARCHITECTURE / PARITY / ADR / this file)
2. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — system shape, module map, invariants
3. `docs/LOOP_PLAYBOOK.md` — the phased build plan; work happens as loop phases
4. `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` — branches development→staging→main, guards, `GusDawn123`
   account. Feature work: branch `dev-<who>-<topic>` off `development`, PR back into
   `development` ONLY (never staging/main), merge development INTO the feature to
   update (never the reverse), re-test, push. Merge commits only; branches survive
   merge. AI PRs (`dev-claude-*`) wait for Gustavo's go-ahead to merge.

## Hard prohibitions

- **NEVER read, copy, or transcribe from `~/Documents/natively-cluely-ai-assistant`.**
  Personal-use license; legally off-limits for this commercial product (RULES §9).
  If you need to know "how X works," derive from public patterns and docs/ specs here.
- No secrets in the repo. No vendor keys in the mobile app, ever.
- No unmetered paths to paid vendor APIs (everything flows through `modules/metering`).
- Never claim "done" without the phase's mechanical verification passing.

## Commands

*(Populated in Phase 0 — keep current in the same PR that changes them.)*

```
npm run check        # typecheck + lint + tests + migration shadow-apply (mergeable = green)
supabase start       # local real Postgres (never test against anything else)
```

## Conventions

- Branches: `dev-<who>-<topic>` (e.g. `dev-claude-rls-policies`); scripts verb-first
  (`backfill_*`). Style rules: docs/RULES.md §10 (Prettier + typescript-eslint
  strict-type-checked; discriminated unions over boolean flags; async/await only;
  screens dumb / hooks smart; tokens-only styling; snake_case SQL)
- Module anatomy: `ports.ts / adapters/ / service.ts / routes.ts / schemas.ts / __tests__/`
- Soft cap ~400 lines/file — split before you blow past it
- Structured errors + logs with `request_id`/`user_id`; never log secrets or raw
  transcripts at info level
